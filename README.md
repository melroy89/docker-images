# Docker Images

These are various Docker images by Melroy (also uploaded to [my Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/danger89)).

## Images

- [CMake](./cmake): A Debian slim base image with CMake, Boost, Ninja, Doxygen and Cppcheck pre-installed. Including also: `cpplint`, `valgrind`, `pip`, `clang-format` and more.
- [GTK, Gtkmm, Cmake](./gtk-cmake-ninja): Based on the CMake image (see above). However, with GTK and Gtkmm (C++), both GTK3 and GTK4 dev packages are pre-installed. With all the same tools like Ninja, Doxygen, etc from the CMake image.
- [pnpm](./pnpm): A Node.js alpine base image with `pnpm` (npm replacement) pre-installed. Ideal for CI/CD runs.
- [debian-pnpm](./debian-pnpm): A Node.js Debian based image with pnpm, which has `apt` command and much more. Try to use the `pnpm` docker image instead if possible, since this image is bigger.
- [php](./php): A PHP Docker CLI image with `composer`, as well as `ssh`, `rsync`, `unzip` and `7z` installed. Ideal for [CodeIgniter 4](https://www.codeigniter.com/) projects with `phpmetrics`.
- [rust](./rust): A Rust Docker image (Debian based) with Node.js, pnpm and `build-essential` installed. Ideal for projects that uses [NAPI-RS](https://napi.rs/).
